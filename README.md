# Asphodel

## What?

Asphodel is a style/syntax checkers aimed to discover patterns during
the writing process.

It helps to recognize the position of adverbs, verbs, noum, etc, in a
text. This technique was suggested by Juli√°n Herbert (a renown latinamerican writer)
in a novel workshop.

## Why?

Sometimes it's useful to be aware of some gramatical categories (parts
of the speech for the English Language) in order to avoid cacophonies
and improve the prose rhythm.

## What's an asphodel
